<h1>8-Puzzle Search Solver</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project implements a solution to the classic 8-puzzle problem as part of a coursework requirement for an introductory Artificial Intelligence class. The objective was to demonstrate state-space search for solving the puzzle from various initial configurations.

The project explores the problem using two search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and a depth-limited version of Depth-First Search (DFS). The program generates the search tree, tracks explored states, and outputs a solution path from the initial configuration to the goal state.

The puzzle was solved for two different initial configurations, with the program visualizing the search process and reporting the number of steps and nodes expanded.

<h2>Concepts Demonstrated</h2>

- <b>State-Space Representation</b> – Modeling puzzle states and transitions  
- <b>Search Tree Construction</b> – Tracking paths through the solution space  
- <b>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</b> – Uninformed search strategy  
- <b>Depth-Limited DFS</b> – Recursive depth-bounded exploration  
- <b>Goal Testing</b> – Detecting solution states  
- <b>Backtracking</b> – Reconstructing the solution path  

<h2>Language Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> – for implementing search algorithms and state handling
