<h1>8-Puzzle Search Solver</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project was done as a pairwork as part of a coursework requirement for my junior-year introductory Artificial Intelligence class. It implements a solution to the classic 8-puzzle problem, and demonstrated state-space search for solving the puzzle from different initial configurations.

Two search strategies were implemented: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Greedy Best-First Search. The program builds the search tree, explores all possible states, and traces a path from the initial configuration to the goal state.

The 8-puzzle was solved for two given initial configurations.
